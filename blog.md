To introduce myself, I am Matthieu Medeng Essia, Master Student in Data Science. I have been working for two months as an intern in the medical Research Centre of the Schweitzer Foundation in Gabon, as a research student in a Research Lab, and learned several languages that I speak quite well, as French, German, Fang, Japanese and Chinese for instance.
